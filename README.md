In 2024 AD, Trump became president of 'murica, he banned aliens from 'murica, aliens got offended and after many debates, the alien assembly decided to invade earth, opposums are our only hope against the aliens, please help us for the greater justice !!!!

2. Hardware compatibility and emulators
Opposum Massage Simulator works on American and Japanese e-Readers, for emulation you'll need mGBA (https://mgba.io/) A GBA bios file is needed for the game to work.

3. Compiling shenanigans
For compiling the game, you'll need devkitpro, its recommended to use linux (For Windows users: you'll need to modify the makefiles to run nedcmake tools.)
Makefile.er is for the US e-Reader, Makefile.erj is for the Japenese e-Reader. (For Japanese e-Readers: you need to use NO$GBA built in assembler to make the final binary by selecting the OPOSSUM.A22 file.)
